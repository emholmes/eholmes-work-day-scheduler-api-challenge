# Work Day Scheduler
## Week 5: Third-Party API Challenge

This repository contains the code for a simple work day scheduler/planner. This app uses jQuery and Moment.js to dynamically update HTML and CSS (Bootstrap is also used for styling). Features include: 
- Ability to add tasks to the planner in hour timeblocks.
- Tasks entered can be saved in local storage by clicking the corresponding save button.
- Planner shows time blocks for a standard business day, 9am - 5pm. 
- Current day always displayed at the top of the page. 
- Timeblocks are color-coded to indicate the current hour of the day, updating automatically.
